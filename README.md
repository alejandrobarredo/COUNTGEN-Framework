# COUNTGEN-Framework
This framework leverages the generative power of GANs in a multi-objective setting to evaluate the vulnerabilities of a Target Classifier Model.

- The folder ./Experimnentation contais the experiments run for the paper submitted to XXX
- The folder ./Framework contains the actual framework in wich you can input your own models to test.
      To work with the framework directly you need to use models in tesorflow 2.x and you will need:
          - A trained GAN (generator and discriminator)
          - A target classifier
